# 🚀 **What is PYTHON_WORLD?**

PYTHON_WORLD is **not a normal repository**.  
It is a **growing life-form**, powered by Python scripts.

This repo evolves like a game:

- 🟢 Start small  
- 🟡 Learn more  
- 🔵 Build better  
- 🟣 Grow stronger  
- 🔥 Unlock levels  

The snake animation above **changes automatically as your repository grows**.  
It becomes longer as you add more contributions, files, and commits.
